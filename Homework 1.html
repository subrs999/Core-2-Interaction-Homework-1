        <h3>Describe your previous experiences with coding.</h3>
        <p>I am quite familiar with html, css and a little bit of Javascript. In JS, I have worked with arrays, functions and loops as well as APIs and JS libraries such as p5 and matter.js. I would say I could still develop my understanding of Javascript by creating more varied projects. I also have some familiarity with python and arduino coding.</p>
        <h3>What classes have you already taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?</h3>
        <p>I have taken Core 1: Interaction last year as well as just taught myself on the side.</p>
        <h3>What parts of the class resonated with you?</h3>
        <p>The aspect of the class that resonates with me the most is both being able to code something which I have designed and elevating that design, and also the aspect of problem solving in coding. I enjoy being able to think over problems I am having and finding cool solutions to them.</p>
        <h3>What parts were most confusing?</h3>
        <p>Making my work responsive on different screen sizes was complex, especially when I have an element dependant on screen size. It feels that the intentionality I put in the location in my design for a laptop screen is lost when it is translated to that of a mobile screen size.</p>
        <h3>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in this class to help reduce this anxiety?</h3>
        <p>I am really excited to learn how to code and develop my projects even further</p>
        <h3>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</h3>
        <p>I want to work with different technology such as VR and web design and I feel that coding will be very beneficial in those fields.</p>
        <h3>What text editor do you prefer to use?</h3>
        <p>Visual Studio Code</p>
        <h3>Have you used GitHub before?</h3>
        <p>I have used GitHub before, but I want to get more familiar with the intricacies of the program.</p>
        <h3>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. “Bonus points” for creative analogies.</h3>
        <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be described with food, where the ingredients you use in a dish are like that of HTML, the way you plate a dish is like CSS and JavaScript is the variety of ways you can prepare a dish, making the dish more palatable.</p>
        <h3>Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there’s 6 levels of heading tags).</h3>
        <h1>Indian Food</h1>
        <h2>Pasta</h2>
        <h3>Burger</h3>
        <h4>Pad Thai</h4>
        <h5>Bibimbap</h5>
        <h6>Pizza</h6>
        <h3>Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites. Include a paragraph for each site describing why it is important to you.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://coastalworld.com/">Coastal World</a>
                <p>Even though this site is sometimes really slow, it is really cool how an entire large scale 3d game cna be played on the web</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>
                <p>Even though some of the sites can sometimes be a little too over-the-top, I really like to variety of inspiration and sites available on this site.</p>
